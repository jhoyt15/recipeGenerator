# recipeGenerator

## Project Overview
A Python application that is used to generate recipe recommendations from a database of recipes

## Problem Statement
Recently, I have been attempting to learn how to cook; one challenge that I, as well as many other beginners face, is finding a variety of interesting recipes. Eating the same three meals on rotation becomes bland and unexciting quickly. To solve this problem, I decided to make an app that allows me to enter a list of ingredients that I have on hand; the application will then query a database for recipes that most closely match these ingredients. 

## Required Installations
* PyQt5
